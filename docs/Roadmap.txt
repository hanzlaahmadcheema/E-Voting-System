📌 Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1 - 2) – All Members  
🔹 Common Tasks:  
   • Set up GitHub Repository with proper branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, `feature` branches).  
   • Define the project architecture and directory structure.  
   • Establish coding standards (naming conventions, documentation rules).  
   • Install required tools (C++ compiler, MySQL, debugging tools).  
   • Plan and finalize the database schema & data structures.  
   • Write basic setup scripts for database initialization.

📌 Hanzla Ahmad – Core Voting Logic & DSA Optimization  

🔹 Week 3 - 4: Core Data Structures & Vote Processing  
   • Select efficient data structures (linked lists, BST, hash maps, etc.).  
   • Implement vote storage, retrieval, and validation mechanisms.  
   • Develop the sorting algorithm to rank candidates based on votes.  

🔹 Week 5 - 6: Real-Time Counting & Winner Declaration  
   • Implement real-time vote tracking and automatic counting.  
   • Optimize vote tallying for speed and efficiency.  
   • Handle edge cases (e.g., tied votes, invalid votes).  

🔹 Week 7 - 8: DSA Optimization & Final Testing  
   • Optimize memory usage and algorithm efficiency.  
   • Implement performance benchmarks for the vote-counting process.  
   • Conduct unit tests and debugging for voting logic.

📌 Bilawal Hussain – Database Management & Security  

🔹 Week 3 - 4: Database Schema & Initial Setup  
   • Finalize MySQL database schema.  
   • Define relationships between tables (Voter, Candidate, Election, Vote).  
   • Set up database connection with C++.  

🔹 Week 5 - 6: CRUD Operations & Data Integrity  
   • Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for voters, candidates, and votes.  
   • Apply foreign key constraints, indexing, and referential integrity checks.  

🔹 Week 7 - 8: Security & Performance Optimization  
   • Implement SQL injection protection & user input validation.  
   • Optimize query performance and indexing for large-scale elections.  
   • Implement backup & recovery strategies.

📌 Meeral Nafees – CLI Interface & User Interaction  

🔹 Week 3 - 4: UI Design & Registration System  
   • Design the command-line interface (CLI) layout.  
   • Implement user authentication (voter registration, login, role-based access).  
   • Ensure proper input validation & error handling.  

🔹 Week 5 - 6: Voting Process & Admin Features  
   • Develop the vote-casting process via CLI.  
   • Implement admin dashboard for managing voters & candidates.  
   • Display real-time election progress & results.  

🔹 Week 7 - 8: UI Enhancements & Final Testing  
   • Improve CLI design (better prompts, color coding, progress indicators).  
   • Conduct user testing & debug reported issues.  
   • Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.  

______________________________________________________________________________________________

📌 Final Phase (Week 9 - 10) – Integration & Deployment  
✅ Merge all components (backend, database, CLI) into a single system.  
✅ Perform full system testing (performance, security, and usability).  
✅ Document final project setup & instructions.  
✅ Prepare final project report & presentation.

🚀 Key Guidelines for Success  
🔸 Weekly Meetings: Regular team sync-ups to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.  
🔸 Version Control: Always push updates to GitHub and use proper commit messages.  
🔸 Modular Development: Test each module individually before integration.  
🔸 Documentation: Keep everything well-documented for future reference.
