Detailed Roadmap for a Voting System Project

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1 - 2)
âœ… Common Tasks for All Members:  
   â€¢ Set up GitHub Repository for version control.  
   â€¢ Define the project architecture and file structure.  
   â€¢ Establish coding standards (naming conventions, documentation rules, etc.).  
   â€¢ Install necessary tools (C++ Compiler, MySQL, etc.).  
   â€¢ Plan the database schema and data structures together.

ðŸ“Œ Hanzla Ahmad â€“ Core Voting Logic & DSA Optimization  

Week 1 - 2: Planning & Initial Setup  
   â€¢ Understand election requirements (local & national elections).  
   â€¢ Decide on data structures for efficient vote storage and retrieval.  
   â€¢ Set up a basic C++ structure for the voting system.  
   â€¢ Research and select suitable sorting & searching algorithms.  

Week 3 - 2: Vote Processing & Sorting Algorithms  
   â€¢ Implement data structures (linked lists, BST, etc.).  
   â€¢ Code the vote processing logic (storing, retrieving, and validating votes).  
   â€¢ Develop the sorting algorithms for ranking candidates based on vote count.  

Week 5 - 2: Real   â€¢Time Counting & Winner Declaration  
   â€¢ Implement real   â€¢time vote tracking.  
   â€¢ Optimize vote counting algorithms for speed and efficiency.  
   â€¢ Develop the winner declaration system based on vote tallying.  
   â€¢ Ensure that edge cases (e.g., ties) are handled.  

Week 7 - 2: DSA Optimization & Final Testing  
   â€¢ Optimize data structures and algorithms for performance.  
   â€¢ Work on code efficiency and memory management.  
   â€¢ Test the entire voting logic under different scenarios.

ðŸ“Œ Bilawal Hussain â€“ Database Management & Security  

Week 1 - 2: Database Schema Design & Setup  
   â€¢ Design the SQL database schema.  
   â€¢ Define relationships between Voter, Candidate, Election, and Vote tables.  
   â€¢ Set up the MySQL database locally or on a server.  

Week 3 - 2: CRUD Operations & Data Integrity  
   â€¢ Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations.  
   â€¢ Validate data integrity (prevent duplicate voters, secure candidate data).  
   â€¢ Ensure referential integrity (foreign key constraints, unique indexes).  

Week 5 - 2: Database Security & Optimization  
   â€¢ Apply input validation & SQL injection protection.  
   â€¢ Optimize database queries for faster data retrieval.  
   â€¢ Implement backup and recovery strategies for database safety.  

Week 7 - 2: Performance Testing & Final Adjustments  
   â€¢ Test database under load (simulating high voter turnout).  
   â€¢ Fine   â€¢tune query performance & indexing.  
   â€¢ Integrate the database with the C++ backend.

ðŸ“Œ Meeral Nafees â€“ CLI Interface & User Interaction  

Week 1 - 2: UI Design & Registration System  
   â€¢ Plan the command   â€¢line interface (CLI) layout.  
   â€¢ Implement the voter and candidate registration system.  
   â€¢ Ensure proper input validation & error handling.  

Week 3 - 2: Voting Process & User Interaction  
   â€¢ Develop the vote   â€¢casting process through CLI.  
   â€¢ Ensure smooth navigation & user feedback messages.  
   â€¢ Implement confirmation prompts & error handling.  

Week 5 - 2: Admin Features & Testing  
   â€¢ Create an admin dashboard for managing voters & candidates.  
   â€¢ Implement log reports to track election progress.  
   â€¢ Conduct unit testing on all UI interactions.  

Week 7 - 2: Final Debugging & UI Refinements  
   â€¢ Ensure smooth user experience & bug fixes.  
   â€¢ Improve CLI design & usability (color coding, better prompts).  
   â€¢ Conduct final user testing & documentation.  

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ“Œ Final Phase (Week 9   â€¢10) â€“ Integration & Deployment  

âœ… Merge all components (backend, database, CLI).  
âœ… Run full system tests for performance, security, and usability.  
âœ… Prepare final project report & documentation.  
âœ… Create a presentation for submission.

ðŸ”¹ Key Guidelines for Success:  
ðŸ”¸ Regular Meetings: Weekly team check   â€¢ins to discuss progress & blockers.  
ðŸ”¸ Version Control: Always push code updates to GitHub.  
ðŸ”¸ Testing & Debugging: Test each module before integration.  
ðŸ”¸ Documentation: Keep clear documentation for future reference.
